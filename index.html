        <h2>Wifi</h2>
        <p>
            Wi-Fi is a wireless networking technology that uses radio waves to provide wireless high-speed Internet access. A common
            misconception is that the term Wi-Fi is short for "wireless fidelity," however Wi-Fi is a trademarked phrase that refers
            to IEEE 802.11x standards.

        Wi-Fi usually refers to the wireless local area networking technique based on the IEEE 802.11 family of standards [47].
        It is a short-range wireless communication technique, which is primarily used for providing network communication
        capabilities to different devices in private, public, and commercial environments [48,49]. As most devices (e.g., Wi-Fi
        access points, smartphones, laptops, and watches) are Wi-Fi enabled, this makes Wi-Fi signals a natural choice for
        ambient backscatter and one of the most widely studied excitation signals in the literature. IEEE 802.11 supports
        various frequencies, such as 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands. Regarding 2.4 GHz band, it is divided into 14 channels
        with a bandwidth of 22 MHz and spaced 5 MHz apart from each other except for a 12 MHz space before channel 14, as shown
        in Fig. 6. The channels labeled as 1, 6, and 11 are a set of non-overlapping channels. Thus, the backscatter tag in
        Wi-Fi backscatter systems usually uses a frequency phase of 20 MHz to avoid interference to the original signal.
        
        There are many different versions of Wi-Fi, such as 802.11a [50], 802.11b [51], 802.11 g [52], and 802.11n [53].
        Different versions of Wi-Fi use different techniques. In terms of 802.11n Wi-Fi, it supports Multiple-Input
        Multiple-Output (MIMO) technology. The technology can significantly improve the communication performance of wireless
        systems in terms of reliability and capacity [54]. Thus, if it is possible to acquire the benefits of the MIMO
        technology on low-power tags. Recent study [55] has implemented a MIMO backscatter system with a low bit error ratio and
        high throughput.

    WiFi has dominated the wireless networks for more than a decade. It is a type of wireless communication associated with
    IEEE communication standards such as IEEE 802.11. It is related to direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) and
    frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS). Several categories of WiFi are available including IEEE 802.11a which operates
    on 5 GHz and gives 54 Mbps. Moreover, IEEE 802.11b supports 11 Mbps at 2.4 GHz, while IEEE 802.11n operates on 2.4 GHz.
    Similarly, IEEE 802.11, proposed in 2014, enhances data rate around 1300 Mbps. Furthermore, high speed seamless
    connectivity at 60 GHz has been reported as well. WiFi technology offers localization as it provides ubiquitous
    coverage. WiFi assisted indoor positioning systems have been utilized for location empowered scenarios [47]. This
    promising technology has fostered various applications such as adaptive communication and gesture recognition. The main
    drawbacks in WiFi are security, privacy, and accuracy. Table 4 summarizes key benefits and challenging issues of
    different RF technologies.
